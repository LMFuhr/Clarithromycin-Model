The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin in adults.

In particular, it applies quantitative metabolism by CYP3A4 by taking into account the mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A4 as well as renal elimination of clarithromycin. Thus, the model is fit for purpose to be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions with regard to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
