Clarithromycin is a widely prescribed antibiotic (10) that is mainly metabolized via CYP3A4 (11). It forms a non-covalent metabolic-intermediate complex with CYP3A4 (12) leading to a mechanism-based inhibition (MBI). This MBI is characterized by a non-linear, dose-dependent and irreversible degradation of CYP3A4. Thus, the MBI by clarithromycin leads to a mechanism-based auto-inhibition of metabolism and results in a non-linear increase of clarithromycin exposure after ascending doses of clarithromycin (13). Clarithromycin is also a substrate (14) and competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (15) as well as a substrate (16,17) and competitive inhibitor of human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 (18).
